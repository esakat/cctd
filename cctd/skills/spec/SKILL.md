# CCTD Spec

Interactive planning: discovery → story → task breakdown → SDD specs.
Read `{SKILL_DIR}/../_shared/format.md` for file format specs.

## Routing

Parse $ARGUMENTS to determine entry point:

| Input | Entry Point | Action |
|---|---|---|
| (empty) or free text | Phase 1 | Full flow: discovery → story → tasks → specs |
| Story ID (S001) | Phase 3 | Task breakdown + spec writing for existing story |
| Task ID (S001-001) | Phase 4 | Write/refine spec for single task |

## Phase 1: Discovery (Sync)

Socratic dialogue to uncover requirements. User interaction required.

1. Ask probing questions (max 3-4 per round):
   - What problem does this solve?
   - Who are the target users?
   - Scope and constraints?
   - Integration points?
   - Non-functional requirements?
2. Summarize findings after each round
3. Continue until requirements are clear enough for a User Story
4. Transition to Phase 2 when user confirms

## Phase 2: Story Creation (Sync)

User approval required.

1. Draft User Story:
   - Title
   - User Story (As a... I want... So that...)
   - Acceptance Criteria (testable, specific)
   - Labels, Priority
2. Present to user for approval
3. On approval: create `.tasks/stories/{ID}.md` and update `index.md`
4. Display: `✅ {ID} \`{title}\` を作成 (DEFINED)`
5. Proceed to Phase 3

## Phase 3: Task Breakdown (Semi-sync)

Present plan, user approves before creation.

1. Analyze the story's requirements and AC
2. Break down into implementation tasks. For each:
   - Title (specific, actionable)
   - Agent type (see format.md)
   - Model: `opus` (default) or `sonnet` (simple/routine only)
   - Dependencies between tasks
   - Priority
3. Present task breakdown:
   ```
   | # | Title | Agent | Model | Deps | Rationale |
   ```
4. Model selection rationale:
   - `opus`: complex design, architecture, multi-file, security-sensitive
   - `sonnet`: config, type definitions, boilerplate, simple single-file changes
5. On approval: create `.tasks/tasks/{ID}.md` for each, update `index.md`
6. Proceed to Phase 4

## Phase 4: SDD Spec Writing (Async)

Claude autonomous. Ask user only when multiple valid approaches exist.

For each task in DEFINED status under the story:

1. Read the story context and task metadata
2. Write the Spec section:
   - What to implement
   - Technical approach / constraints
   - Input/output expectations
   - Files to create or modify
   - Acceptance criteria for this task
3. If multiple valid approaches → **ask user to choose**
4. Run AI_READY checklist (see format.md)
5. If all checks pass → update status to AI_READY
6. Log: `[{date}] Spec作成完了 → AI_READY`

### Teammate Dispatch

Phase 4 can be parallelized via teammates:
- Each task's spec writing is independent (unless shared design decisions)
- Team Manager dispatches per `workflow.md` rules
- Teammate receives: story context + task metadata + instruction to write Spec
- Teammate writes Spec, runs AI_READY checklist, updates status

## Single Task Entry (via Task ID)

When $ARGUMENTS is a task ID (e.g., S001-001):
1. Read the task file and its parent story
2. Execute Phase 4 for this single task
3. If spec already exists, refine/update based on additional context from $ARGUMENTS
